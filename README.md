# Github-link-ph-1-project
I have created an online feed of random beautiful images application/platform such as when the user scrolls down, he gets multiple different images continuously. This would help the user in getting multiple unique choices of images to design as their attractive wallpapers or phone case custom cases.
The images are being fetched from a public API known as picsums.
